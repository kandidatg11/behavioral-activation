        "we will begin to identify and plan daily activities that help you to live according to "+
        "the values that are most important to you. This is important because when you accomplish "+
        "activities that are closely linked to what you value in life, you are more likely to have "+
        "positive and enjoyable experiences, which will improve how you feel and think about your "+
        "life. It is difficult to feel depressed and hopeless if you are regularly doing activities "+
        "that you feel are valuable and worthwhile and that bring you a sense of pleasure and accomplishment.",
        paragraph2: "This application targets changing your behavior as a method for improving your "+
        "thoughts, feelings, and overall quality of life. Many individuals with depression often "+
        "feel tired and lack the motivation to do various activities; thinking that once they have "+
        "more energy and think more positively, they will be able to do the activities they have "+
        "ignored or have been unable to accomplish in the past. The opposite approach is taken in "+
        "this treatmentâbehavior is changed first as a way to increase energy and motivation as well "+
        "as positive thinking and feelings. The focus on behavior change, however, does not mean that "+
        "we ignore thoughts and feelings. Instead, we suggest that negative thoughts and feelings "+
        "will change only after you change your behavior and have more positive life experiences. "+
        "Healthy behavior is defined as behavior that is directed toward improving your quality of "+
        "life and attaining the values you have in your life. In contrast with healthy behavior, "+
        "unhealthy (depressed) behavior generally is not directly related to improvements in the "+
        "quality of your life and does not move you closer to living according to your values.",
        paragraph3: "You should know that it is possible for you to be active, yet still be "+
        "depressed. This can happen if you feel overwhelmed with activities that are unfulfilling "+
        "or forced by others. For example, although you may be busy at work and home, these "+
        "activities may be focused only on helping others. Although it certainly is important "+
        "to help others, it is never a good idea to focus so much on others that your own needs "+
        "and feelings are completely neglected. Focusing entirely on the needs of others may "+
        "result in feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction, followed by confusion and guilt "+
        "for having such feelings. Thus, it is important not only to have many activities in "+
        "your life but also specifically to have activities that bring you some degree of "+
        "pleasure and fulfillment."

        "including decreased optimism or motivation, low self-esteem, trouble concentrating "+

        "associated with depression include heart disease, chronic pain, type 2 diabetes, "+
        "substance use, fatigue, and malnutrition. Individuals with depression often keep to "+
        "themselves and avoid their normal activities. This isolation can cause additional "+
        "problems, such as loneliness, relationship problems, decreased job satisfaction or "+
        "unemployment, and educational failure. Given all these resulting problems, the "+
        "identification and treatment of depression are critical.",
        paragraph2: "The specific symptoms of depression may include the following:",
        dot1: "- Feeling sad or down most of the time,",

        paragraph3: "Although most individuals experience some form of the above symptoms "+
        "from time to time, a diagnosis of depression only is made if you feel strong feelings "+
        "of distress, or you are having a lot of trouble with your day-to-day functioning. "+
        "Some people can identify stressful life events including loss of a loved one, financial "+
        "difficulty, or job loss as a reason for their depression. However, the specific causes "+
        "of depression are rarely known, and depression might start without warning. Regardless "+
        "of the initial cause of depression, depression results in a specific pattern of behavior "+
        "that leads to feelings of loneliness, sadness, isolation, lack of purpose, and/or "+
        "hopelessness. The key to feeling better is not in identifying the root cause of depression "+
        "because this is nearly impossible, but rather in understanding and changing your depressed "+
        "patterns of behavior."

    stress: {
        header1: "Stressful life events and loss in your life",
        paragraph1:"Often people who have experienced stressful life events and loss end up having "+
        "long-standing feelings of depression. After something very bad has happened or loved ones "+
        "are lost, life can feel empty or meaningless. It can feel as if there is very little to "+
        "live for and that all the support and happiness you once had is gone forever. Thoughts "+
        "and bad dreams may keep coming back about the bad experience or about the loved one who "+
        "has passed away. In this treatment, it is very important for the therapist to understand "+
        "what happened to you, how you felt about it, and most importantly, how it affects your life "+
        "now. At every session, we will spend some time talking about events in your life that have "+
        "led to your depression. However, this treatment requires more than just talking about what "+
        "has happened. In addition, we also will spend some time trying strategies that will help "+
        "you to live a more fulfilling and meaningful life going forward. Nobody can change events "+
        "of the past, but we can plan for a better future by what we do today. Often, when people "+
        "have experienced stressful life events and loss, negative thoughts and feelings about the "+
        "event come to mind all the time. It becomes hard not to think about it or feel terrible "+
        "that it happened. We find that it is important to understand how these experiences affect "+
        "your current behavior. Often after a loss or stressful life event, people change how they "+
        "spend their time, and this can lead to depressed behavior patterns. For example, you might "+
        "find it difficult to sleep at night, and so you spend a lot of time sleeping during the day. "+
        "If you sleep during the day, you may be unable to perform important daily activities or "+
        "lack the energy and desire to socialize with family and friends. This treatment will help "+
        "you to identify activities that might be making your depression worse and can help you "+
        "modify or change those activities so that you feel depressed less often. After a loss or "+
        "stressful event, it can often take time and focus to decide how you want to live your life "+
        "moving forward, and this treatment is designed to help you with that. The goal is to help "+
        "you make the best life possible for yourself. This can be hard work, but if you trust the "+
        "process you will find that good things will come from your effort. We will work at a pace "+
        "that is comfortable for you. Are you willing to work on this together?"
